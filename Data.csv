Nice product...üëçüëç..,5,1
"It says 8 hrs but since I use this to watch lectures it gives more than 15hrs+ battery life.Sound quality is good, Highs & Lows are perfectly managed but to term these as Bass Heavy would be widely mistake.Overall 4 stars",4,1
the base is really good. it a value for this range of money.i really liked it.only the comfort has to be more good.,4,1
"This product was had manufacturing defect inside the plastic band material,from which it is now broken out, that could not be visible during product receiving time period. Please do something for this automatic damaging, I wanted number of time to connect with customer care service but no any my call receiving by customer service. Please do the satisfactory advice to repair or exchange purpose because this product is under guarantee period. I was received this order on 14 May 2020.",1,0
"Edit: After 1 year of usage.The headphone starts developing cracks in the overhead plastic band, the padding on the earcups and head band started coming off. The boat logo has completely vanished (all this happened even after taking utmost care). The sound is still fine.Please be aware of the cheap plastic and poor built quality of the headphone. Instead of this you can buy Blaupunkt BH01 Eqz headphones which are the best at this price.PS. The gold plating on the AUX cable will come off creating much disturbance while connecting and listening to music rendering it useless.EDIT: The sound cut-offs are annoying during watching films or playing. You can't hear some dialogues at low volume.Honest review after 46 days of usage...PROS:‚Ä¢ Good sound quality, vocals are crystal clear. Nice to see AUX cable bundled in the box itself.‚Ä¢ You can get rich bass in Bluetooth and above average bass using the wired connection.‚Ä¢ The ear cups are padded with good quality foam and faux leather, no pain on continuous use (Used it for 2-2.5 hours and was still very comfortable).‚Ä¢ Value for money, Got it for 1099/- only.‚Ä¢ Not Bass heavy but you can tweak settings to get good bass.‚Ä¢ Good fit and design.‚Ä¢ Good Battery backup, got 7 hrs+ on single charge. Full charge takes about 2-3 hours, the orange LED goes off when fully charged.‚Ä¢ Build quality is good considering the price of the product.‚Ä¢ Call quality is average (the speaker is not so loud). The headphone also tells the Caller‚Äôs Number during an incoming call.‚Ä¢ The Latency is also acceptable at this price point.CONS:‚Ä¢ On Bluetooth, when the volume is kept very low and the music has a very low pitch, sometimes the left-right speakers turn ON and OFF automatically. (It can be eliminated by keeping volume bar at about 50%, also no problem when connected using Aux cable). I saw this problem in boAt Rockerz 450 as well.‚Ä¢ When kept at 100% volume the sound tends to get distorted. (Its THD-Total Harmonic Distortion is ‚â§5%, whereas most good headphones have it at ‚â§1%)‚Ä¢ The aux cable seems to be too thin so be careful while handling it.‚Ä¢ The earcups are not sweat resistant so take care of it.",2,0
Sound is very crystal clearBass is very pretty and goodValue for money,5,1
Bass is disgusting... Range is good but when I tried PUBG it keeps disconnecting continuously...Useless headphone...I returned it on the same day I received.,1,0
I have used it for 1 month after then the headphone literally breaked. Please My Dear friends a slight little push can break it. Headphone quality Is Cheap. Not for gamers. Dont Buy It,1,0
"Marvelous performanceIf you watch movies or series in Netflix,amazon or Hotstar this head set is perfect option Crysta clear sound may be not deep bass but you feel like theatre effect with perfect clear sound just go for it .....",4,1
"I have been a huge fan of BoaT and have been purchasing headphones and wireless-only from them since it is an indian company.But, i was let down on the above product. Within one month the thing is broken. The sad part is that, when I uploaded the invoice which was downloaded from Amazon itself, the company BoaT has send a message to me stating the invoice is not theirs. So weird!!!So, when it comes to faulty products they have funny excuses to say NO.",1,0
"Headphones are great but recieved the already used by someone headphones. Seal was broken and was reattached. Scratches were visible along side the earcups. Also when i watch something on Netflix, either the right side or the left one randomly keeps disconnecting and reconnecting Returned the product.",4,1
"Didn't last for a month... It just broke .. as you can see. As one moth is over Amazon won't take it back. Whome to blame here Amazon or boat company!!If you still want to purchase..... Then go for jbl and sony products. Atleast they'll last much longer than than this pathetic product. You may spend 500-1000 extra money, but it worth it",1,0
Nice,4,1
Plz don't buy this product.. after using half an hour your ears will start paining. Instead on ads they should work on quality of products.it broke after usage of one month.totally wastage of money.,1,0
"Well I am writing this review after 6 months of daily usage. If you are looking for a headphone in mid range budget with awesome sound quality with a perfect bass then go for this.After my 6 months usage, I am totally satisfied with this product. The battery backup wonders me. After a full charge, if you use it 5-6 hours per day then it will last for about 4-5 days.The sound quality is also of high definition. Bass is also wonderful. Connectivity range is also good not very good. Just one thing with what I would like to say it Ok is its microphone . Microphone works well in noise cancelling but range of mic is some less.Overall you can purchase this product without any worries. I hope that you also will like it.I am regretting one thing also that is I had ordered black colour which I am not liking much as compared to other two colours",5,1
Boat Rockers 310 is perhaps the best sounding product below Rs 1200. It's treble bass and volume up down functions are very good. The curved bar is soft and padded covered by leather. Once charged it can be used for 5 to 6 hours in Bluetooth connectivity mode. Aux cable and micro usb cable is provided as asseccory in packing box. A good choice to buy.,5,1
"¬†So , the most important thing that attracts me buy these headphones is their DESIGNS that's was too much mind-blowing that no headphone have in this price range , I get these Rockerz at 1000 in the sale ... Let's talk about some imp. Points that we all wanna know ..Pros:-1.BASS ( 5/5 )2.Tereble ( 5/5 )3.Build Quality ( 4/5 )Note :- It's all depend on how u r using your product whether roughly or nicely.. if u use them wisely then there's no issue with build quality.4. Looks ( 5/5 ) BLACK & GOLDEN fits better for this one.5.MIC ( 4/5)Note:- There's some NOISE CANCELLATION I thought so , it's bit Lower for others to hear while call but that also manage-able Not a HUGE issue6.Bluetooth Range ( 5/5 )No problem üëç the range is good compared to the others ..CONS :-1.AUX CABLE ( 2/5 )Note :- It's too thin u have to purchase new one from aftermarket hardly it will cost u around 30 or 40 IF U PURCHASE A GOOD ONE .2.USB cable ( 2/5 )Note :- Same issue like with the AUX one , it's also too thin , but it's OK we all can adjust in this price range .... Also I mentioned my own clicked photos there so u can check and assure youself ...I bought them for my online classes and for listening some songs daily basis üòéMost of the YOUTUBE channel says ""the bass is not upto the mark "" but I think u should try once by your own and really u will have no issue with it , Both of your üëÇ(ears) start  vibrating with the bass.. that feels awesome.. According to my perspective I will give  ( 4.5/5 )Go for this amazing ROCKERZ 370.. if u think that this REVIEW helps u to gain a perfect knowledge about these HEADPHONES then plzz like it.",5,1
"Poor Basic Headphones. Highly Overpriced. Sound is normal, no special bass or noise cancellation. Build and look very cheap and basic. Buttons not strudy. Unnecessarily Big. Does not look durable. Initial reaction - Very Bad. Amazon do not return Electronics if unsatisifed, only option to replace. No use as did not like the product itself.",1,0
"Product broke after 3 months of usage.not happy.i have claimed for a return and am waiting for a response from boat team.though when I called the customer service and said that the issue with my complaint is that one of the bands is broken,they said they cannot help me as it is physical damage.guys I did not have a problem with the audio but it did break very soon.i don‚Äôt think I am going to get a return on this product so I suggest you to go for a different product",1,0
"No Voice cancellation in this product, for this cost, this is not worth product, Boat company is good in headset, but manufacturing such products will loose its brand image in the market",1,0
My ears and head stared paining. It's uncomfortable and the bass is also not good. The sound also bursts.,1,0
I would like to start with pro sound is good and battery life also goodNow the con's you can't use it on summer because it will heat up you're ear and you can't use it for long time because it will hurt ear overall I can say it's a good product but I can't use it on summer it's hurting my ear,4,1
"After reading these reviews where some people really didn't like it and where some people loved it, I got really skeptical. I probably was about to cancel my order. But I got it anyways and It's so good. It fits my ears perfectly, it doesn't pain even after hours of usage. The sound is more than loud enough with enough bass and also has this really good theater effect. Kinda makes me look like a gamer girl not gonna lie lmao. But, anyways. So far my experience has been good. And yes it might be a little delicate but which headphones are not??? Just buy it guys don't fall for the bad reviews this headset is beautiful!!!",5,1
Super mind blowing,5,1
"This product has poor built quality there is no voice cancellation at first when I ordered it it was pretty well but it started giving me problems after few weeks it had problem in connectiveti with Bluetooth and in some calls it would automatically ends the call . It not at all good for gameing . It has a very poor noise cancellation fataliti . After few weeks it just broke by stretching when I was wereing it for use poor quality if you are buying it is only good for less use or it will start creating problem it has an average sound quality.it is not good for meeting ,classes, gameing  very bad quality recommended not to buy this product is very bad no noise cancellation facility very bad build quality so you should not buy this product .very bad product this by stretching it breaks so build quality is very bad it does not  has an noise cancellation facility and this auxillary works not very well so I recommend not to buy this product",2,0
The headphones are kinda good in terms of the audio quality and battery backup.......but the build and the quality of the headphones is not that great as the ones which I ordered broke like shown in the photo and this happened very close to the time I actually ordered it and started using it........I used the headphones as I would have used any other headphones but the headphones just came apartü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2,0
"Sound is all good and good hearing over bluetooth too, when connected to mobile / laptop. But 2 major issues I experienced:1. Cannot use bluetooth for making calls, attending meeting where I need to speak. The receiver is not able to hear my voice even though I kept the volume to maximum. So I am forced to use a wired connection for the mic to pickup my voice and make it audible to the other side.2. The build quality - Bought this in April 2021. The headset broke 10 days back, making it unusable. This is the first time a product like headset is broke [see photo] within 6 months of usage. I could have used it for not more than 200 hours at the maximum. Don't know if this is covered in the 1 year warranty that Boat has promised. Now I bought another headset of another brand. Actually disappointed with Boat over these issues.",3,0
Bought it almost 4 months ago.Works fine while using it with the aux cable. But while in bt mode the music kinda fluctuates in low volumes.( Either left or right cut off or both of them cut offs)Had it increase volume so that the music starts Playing again.Not so happy with how it sits on my head.Might look good but ergonomics are poor.The build is alos not that satisfying.Already had many hairline cracks.,2,0
Sound quality is no doubt a good point becoz of Boats company but i feel its Bluetooth connectivity is little bit pathetic sometimes it does connect with anybody else's phone and just make sure tht u have Ur phone very near 2 u otherwise there's a glitch which I heard from Google is dangerous due to the rays and I'll recommend u too charge even at 90 % battery becoz glitch starts to occur otherwise and yess it doesn't fall while exercising so that's a good point 2 me. Overall since 2 months usage it's been good and I keep it in its box only after usage and I got at a reasonable price so it's grrt fr me !,4,1
"Don‚Äôt purchase any boat headphone from Amazon, that was duplicate product,there is number started with R printed on head band ,not present in this product..Side determination as L/R not mentioned over metallic bar over head band,no boat logo printed over apex of head band,lastly poor quality sound and bass,quality of cushion over ear cups was of cheap material.After returning that I purchased same model from Myntra,where all points I mentioned satisfied me‚Ä¶DONT PURCHASE ANY BOAT PRODUCT FROM AMAZON",1,0
"I bought this to attend online classes of my college the battery life is very awesome i charge it once for 4-5 hours and it keeps working for more than a week, the quality of sound is nice but long hours of listening causes pain in ears which almost every headphones do,other than that best headphones, i purchased these at 999 in Amazon sale so at a big profit. Thanks for reading.",5,1
This product is just okay and not so great.I would have rated 3.5-4 star but below are the reason why I rated less.Reduced 1.5-2 start because of product quality. Build quality of head phone is just-just average ar somewhat between below average to average. The charging cable & jack cable are of very bad-cheap quality.Also reduced 1 star because it is not compatible with many devices for e.g. my use-case was to use it with my MacBook but it is not working with it. I is just working with Windows laptop / Android phone but I most use head phone with my MacBook for meetings.Hence 1 star.Thanks,1,0
"I have been using this earphone for 4 months now, i was not sure about it first but now I am fairly satisfied . Here are some honest  pros and cons of this earphone.PROS:1. Battery: I can't express how much I am satisfied with it, The packaging says 12 hrs runtime ,but it clearly gives me over 20 hrs. I usually have to charge it 2-3 timesa month. Believe me it sounds unbelievable but it is true.2. Sound quality : sound quality is fairly clear and bass is also very good, at this price  it is as expected.3. Comfortable: I was not sure about comfort first as my ears were was hurting too much, BUT after 2-3 DAYS IT BEACAME TOTALLY COMFORTABLE. Now if I wear it for whole day long, my ears don't even feel itCONS:1. light and generic build quality, it's very light and generic, doesn't give a premium feel ,and always I have to use it cautiously because i feel it would break2. Mike is very very  bad, no one can hear my voice through mike3. If you stand near wi fi router, it may cause interference in sound.",5,1
"For the price of 1100 with bluetooth 5, its a 4 star product. Some flaws are there too. Made of plastic, so will easily degrade/break. The funtion keys only work on bluetooth mode not with AUX cable. Ear cushion not too great, after long hours it may cause pain in ears.",4,1
"I am using this headphone from last 2 days, here's my experience -1. I got this one for 13992. Battery capacity is really good, 10+ hrs3. Sound quality is good4. Bluetooth connectivity is good5. The biggest problem is its ear cushions, they're really tight , you can't wear it continuously even for an hour",3,0

"I can't believe the experience I've had with these headphones, when they arrived, I was unable to activate the warranty for it even after following all the steps mentioned in the package. Just after 20 days one side stopped working but it would suddenly start and stop working from time to time. I tried calling a service station but no one would pick up and provide me with any assistance, after a month and a half, one side has completely stopped working and now these headphones are just a waste, I wrote them a mail as well to help me with this issue and got no response. Don't buy this product it's not durable at all and has basically no after-sales support.",1,0
"My son says the sound is AWESOME (all-caps = excitement level!), and he's 14 years old so that's a HUGE compliment for this amazing product. As for noise cancellation, he doesn't even hear me when I'm right next to him and speaking directly to him - that's how good it is!The build quality is excellent and it lasts for quite a bit longer than the stated time for a single charge. He uses it almost constantly and I haven't seen him charging it more than a couple of times a week.I think this is a very attractive price point because this kind of sound is usually only available on premium brands like JBL and Bose. I also bought some earpods from boAt and I'm pretty happy with that as well. Looks like the brand is very dedicated to providing the best user experience possible at an affordable price.",5,1
"Was working fine for the 1st week. Started to hear a crackling disturbance all the time, in around 2 weeks after buying it. Sadly, the return window had been closed by then. Now stuck with this useless e-waste. Fitting is very tight and uncomfortable. Of all the Bluetooth headsets I have used, this is the most uncomfortable and pathetic product. Go for something else even if they give it for free. As long as it was working fine, sound quality was good with proper noise cancelation.",1,0
"It's been 2 months since I'm using this product..my review is absolutely genuine as i'm facing some issues regarding this product. At the first 2 weeks the cushion (on the ear) of the headphone got removed somehow it could be poor built quality . Then after some time the sound from from left side of the headphone was also not coming. Initially, I though that there could be some issues from my mobile so I restarted the phone but it didn't work out. Then I connected the headphone via bluetooth to the other mobile but it didn't worked as well.. I suppose the headphone itself have an issue.. It might be hardware problem.. REALLY DISAPPOINTED!!",1,0
"Hey there i purchased this headphones mostly for microphone and online classes. As microphone was my top priority I tested microphone quite a lot with bot pc and phone with some music during late night studies :)Pros----very nice microphone , the other person was able to hear me properly even if i was far from Device. One thing to note is when on pc you have to use AG handsfree calling mode not stereo else you won't be able to listen anything what other ppl is saying. Also ag is mono channel so it degrades sound quality which u get from headphones.But this isn't this headphones issue its just bluetooth mess which no one bothers to fix.----battery lifeBattery life is quite good tbh will easily last 3 4 days if u do mostly online classes and little music listening at night :)----connectivityConnectivity is pretty solid between the walls yeah bit struggles but considering how congested my airspace is with radiowaves blasting here and there connection was pretty solid.Cons:-----buildBuild is cheap and hollow , i expect cheap but it feels like toy and not at all sturdy , so handle with care-----sound qualitySound quality is below average tbh , on 50% volume its good , but when u go around 20% 25% then the headphones starts to skip few beats which are of lower amplitude , i dont know if its my unit of what but it does this every time. And wonder why i listen at 20% coz at night 20% feels like 60% of day coz we perceive volume relative to other volumes/loudness.-----comfortWell i am bit comfy person soo this for me is not much comfortable , i mean 1hr and its done i have to take break of 5 min or so , it's a good thing if u think about your ears but stillüòÖ",4,1
"First of all, hats off to boat. They are improving their product range in every way they can. I saw some reviews in which people moaning about no noise cancelation, poor bass poor quality etc.. please don't bullshit. This is a good product. Look the price! It is very apt product during exercises like heavy lifting. If you want best bass, go for boss. If you want best anc, go for senheisser. This is an economical product. Boat will introduce their flagship anc headset soon and I'm waiting for it. Kudos for boat team.",5,1
The product comes with good package details. But the features are very hard to use. like pressing the button to start or cancel a call is very tough.Sound quality is poor. And its not comfortable to the ears. Its like something heavy is sitting on your ears.Bluetooth auto pairing failed when u receive an incoming call.you really have to struggle to connect.I tried both with my Iphone and Redme device.Don't waste your money on this. Not worth of 999 INR,2,0
Suggestions-  1.  I got it on 2021 during great Indian festival for 899 don't buy it if its at 1.2k or more than that it ain't worth it.  2. Try out the boat rockerz 450 on sale it was priced the same at 899 normally it is around 1.5k  3. Don't spend more than 1k on headphones if you don't have that much budget or you're a student  4. After buying these products goto the company's official website & register the purchase invoice for warranty claim.Like-  1. Good sound quality & sound balance not high base or high pitch balanced in all these  2. Noise cancellation good  3. Bluetooth connectivity good (v 5.0)  4. Comes with aux cable in the box  5. Battery backup is good too(1-2 day 100%-30% in normal usage)Dislike-  1. Cufs are kinda hard type though they contribute in good noise cancellation but ears ache too üòê thumbs down for very long time usage; Solution- make a habit of itüòÇ  2. Right ear cuff comes loose unattached. It's not like its broken or something but it comes in the box like that,3,0
¬†First of all sound quality is very comfortable in this price range i really enjoy the music. Its not premium quality sound but good.2. Connects easily when i turn it on.3.

This is a brilliant product but the fiting is a little uncomfortable on large or average size ears. But if you find a perfect place to waer it on ears it is a good chice. The bass is sooooo good and the volume is so high. The bluetooth connectivity is a lot quick than anyother product. Overall quality of the product is a lot higher than any other product,5,1
"This particular ser was not my first choice even though I wanted a set from Boat. But I settled for this when the other set was not available. Having done so however, don't have any regrets. This has great design, great ergonomics and most of all, absolutely rich and distortion free sound. Very happy with this and would happily recxomend it for everyday use!",5,1
Pros-Sound quality felt actually good for the price.Battery life was absolutely great.Look really greatCons-Low quality cheap filmsy plastic that easily broke off within the first three months.Felt a bit short for my head and caused pain around the ear after wearing for too longI would highly advise against buying this one,2,0
"Its very cool, stylish, and high quality hd bass...just superb",5,1
Its very fragile.. Wire comes out when you try to extend the headphones. Bass is not upto the mark.. Its either too much or very less.. The ear cups dont fit your ear properly.. Its should have been designed in such a way that it fits every ear.. Coushion of ear cups are a bit hard.. Volume is very good..connectivity is also good.. But for such less money its fits in perfectly.. You cant expect more .. All in all its value for money per the price.,4,1
It seems to have problem with bluetooth connection while playing audio. Sometimes I can only hear in one side and my other ear is silent. The problem often remains for a few seconds only which is good . Microphone has some problems while I'm using apps like Google Meet or Zoom. People on the other side has trouble hearing me speak. Sound is okay. Not too loud which I like. I tweaked the equaliser of my Spotify and the bass is good. Overall it's okay for now. Let's see what happens in the long run.,3,0
The quality is good. But I was very dissatisfied with the mic. You can't take a regular call in peace as the person on the other side is unable to listen to you properly.  So there's no other way than disconnecting it and switching to the earpiece.Also after using it for an hour continuosly your ears get kind of sore.But overall it's a good product if you ignore the mic.,3,0
"Sound quality is good but if the product is not comfortable then it is not useful for user. When I try to return it is non returnable. So, it becomes a useless product for me. So, I don't recommend anyone to buy this product from Amazon. Better to go near by shop and purchase a comfortable headset which you use atleast an hour without putting stress on ear. Our hearing power is one of the greatest gift by God use headphones judiciously.",1,0
I bought this a week ago.1st things is we cannot use it for more than 1 hour as this cause ear pain. And also sound quality is good only for music and videos. this headphones doesn't work for calls. Totally useless for calls. I was given replacement option only. I'm really not happy with replacement as I don't want this product. My main purpose for ordering this was for calls and meetings only so I'm totally disappointed.,1,0
"Listening Music during walking is trouble, sound breaks. Mic needs to be closer to mouth while speaking on call otherwise person on the other end complains of voice breaking.You are sitting and headphones are connected to phone/pc ( stationary), then it gives flawless performance.Not for long use, as ears get heated, irritable, sweaty.",4,1
"Decent product1. Build quality - not so nice feels very cheap and sometimes I just thought I broke it...Cushion are very poor in quality,2. Comfort - not so comfortable,Feels like someone press your head so tightly.3. Music quality - high and mids are descent but base should be more soft.Overall it's sounds good.After 4 days of use left driver were gone. So I've returned this product so buy it at your own risk!!!",3,0
"First things first. While opening the pack itself earcup of one side was not in its position. .i.e it was seperated from the headphone ( please refer to image). I was really sad, as I bought this for diwali. I am using boat gadgets from past 2 years, never experienced such things. However, somehow managed to attach those earcup to the headphone. Apart from that, headphone is good. Felt ear pain after using for half an hour, I hope I will get used to it. Sound quality is good, built quality is ok for this price(‚Çπ 899).Update: built quality is not at all good. I think spending little more money and buying some other brand or other model in this same brand is better option.",2,0
"This headphone is the best one out there in this price range. After searching alot for wireless headphones, I finally came up to this and I'm not disappointed. The bass is fantastic and the sound quality is good. But the sound on full volume isn't too loud. So if u have a habit of listening music on very loud volumes, then this is not for u. It's not like the sound is too low, it's just not that loud compared to other headphones but I still enjoy listening music in it. The design is very attractive and the red colour looks beautiful. It's comfortable but u may need to remove it for a few seconds and adjust it again cuz the ears start hurting after using it for like 1-1.5 hours. And most importantly, it has a 1 year warranty. But there's only one thing which I hated about this is that the usb cable provided doesn't even fit in it. Didn't they test it before putting it in? I had to use my phone cable to charge it. Other than that, it's goodMy final verdict- 9/10",4,1
Hi I am going to give clear review about this headset.First of all sound quality is very supper.Bass is also good it comes according to song requirment.Noice cancellation is ok.Battery backup is very powerful.It's sound processing is awesome.I had noticed sound from left speaker comes loud and basse and whereas right has more of vocal therefore sound generated feels like surrounding sound.But it's irritating something but due to this effect sound comes properly.But biggest backpoint is confort you can't were it continues for 1 hrs After some time ears start paining.Overall is perfect product and value for money. Please tell that sound in left speaker is more that right speaker or its my headphones problem.,4,1
the sound quality is great the bass is okay but i do not suggest you to buy this if you are a gamer or use the headphones all day long-the headphone's cushion is not that soft so using it for more than 1 hour can irritate youi dont know if this is a me thing but i get headaches when i wear these.. if you see any other reviews complaining about headaches then dont buy it..,4,1
Writing the review after using 1 week*The ratings I am giving are according to my preference and keep in mind the price also.Sound quality- 3.5/5 - The sound could have been more bright and the bass was good. Vocal separation was okayish.Comfort- 3/5- The earcups are not that soft and start to hurt in long use.Build- 3.5/5 - The build is all plastic with matte finish. Its not that fragile to break easily unless you really try.Battery-4.5/5- The battery life was quite impressive. My daily use is about 5-6 hours and it easily lasted me around 6-7 days on single charge and you also get aux cable if you run out of battery.I also have boat rockerz 450 and the sound quality in that is just slightly better but it is way more comfortable than this so if you have to wear headphones for very long time continuously you can go for it but it also costs more and the build quality on that in quite good too.,4,1
"Bought this for 999/-Its only good thing is battery life. Charging time around 1 hour and gives 3 days of battery life.Bass is fine, you have to tweak the settings in equalizer from phone apps but other than that its fine. ( rockerz 400 had way more bass but very less battery life 8hrs)Sound quality is good for its price, cant complain.the teal blue colour is my fav, it just looks very attractive and also fits well. ( you will get slight discomfort and pain after long usage for around 4 hrs and more, but in time you'll get used to it.)so yes I only love it for the looks and battery life :)Edit: the plastic broke and my headphone is in 2 parts so it's useless after 3 months",2,0
"¬†Pros (advantages)*Sound quality is better than boat rockerz 450*Crystal clear sound*80% charged when arrived* No latency*Bluthoot 5*Heaven like sound quality*upto 10m range*Battery backup 12 hours of continuous use*Comfortable and soft cushions*Connect easily to any devices* Aux cable and USB cable inside box* Free sticker of boat*packaging was soo good*1 year warranty with waranty cardCons:*Built quality is plastic made so we have to use it carefully it may break*in aux cable the sound quality is little bit low but in bluthoot the sound quality is like a heaven*It doesn't has noise cancellation featureOverall id you have a budget under 1000Then definitely definitely definitely you should buy this , this also wireless and sounds sooo good crystal clear, high definition , sounds like heaven so I very very recommended you all to buy this product",5,1
"Product build quality is too bad.In just 2 months I have seen cracks on products .which lead to break downThis product was had manufacturing defect inside the plastic band material,from which it is now broken out, that could not be visible during product receiving time period. Please do something for this automatic damaging, I wanted number of time to connect with customer care service but no any my call receiving by customer service. Please do the satisfactory advice to repair or exchange purpose because this product is under guarantee period. I was received this order on 27 October 2020",1,0
"Earcups/cushion quality very bad. After using 10-15 min starting burning ear. I replaced once after recieving second one still problem is same. Nothing changed after replacement. I am telling you don't buy this product, it is very harmful for ears, and also it startes paining on ears and nearby ears area. Overall it is worst product. Very clear, it makes unwanted pain just after 10-15 minutes of using. If we don't use for 10-15 minutes then we must not buy such kind of product in my point of view....",2,0
"Detective piece received.Looking at the reviews and price tag I ordered one for my kid. The item was received on time as communicated with proper packing.However, The device seems to be unusable. None of our phone (iphone12, OnePlus 8T, MacBook) are able to search the device under Bluetooth connectivity. However when connected with 3.5mm jack it sounded good.Have filed for the replacement and hoping the replacement to work fine.",2,0
"Audio quality is great, music, bass treble everything is good. Could be a little painful for your ears if you're planning to listen music for a continuous period of 2hrs & more and you haven't adjust the headphone according to your head size. Music wise it's great in both bluetooth as well as aux mode, Mic is decent, battery backup is also fine. Overall it's a rocker!",5,1
"The Boat Rockerz 370 is a fantastic headset and a one I would definitely recommend to spend your money on. Has HD sound quality and immersive audio which is recommended if you‚Äôre a gamer. Simple, slick design as well, lightweight, and many more. I bought it in the ‚ÄòRaging Red‚Äô colour scheme which is a combination of red and black which I love. Overall, this pair of headphones is definitely worth it!",5,1
Amazing product !! Specially build quality... Design & controls as well ! Some special areas to be mentioned.. i.e. bass is good so with that vocals are very clear... Bluetooth connectivity also very strong !! Noise cancellation not upto mark but ok & aux cable quality is weak so i think new aux cable need to purchase for those who need dual connectivity otherwise bluetooth are stong to work! One thing specially mention about bass quality that some romours about it that bass eliminated ! But it's totally wrong bass is exist but not so strong so it can help in to hear vocals clearly also ears not damaged with that ! One last earcups are so comfy & also headphone adjust very well with that with head... Overall weight is also good !With low or medium budget it valuable product !!,4,1
Very difficult switches to put the headphones off. Its ok to get connected to your mobile device with this headphone but bey difficult to switch off the headphone without first switching off the mobile device. Its a nightmare experience to use it only because of this reason.......,2,0
"Specially if you are not playing songs on your device and the headphone is connected via bt, it keeps connecting and disconnecting every 5 min, while playing an audio msg ""you have now been disconnected "" and "" you are now connected to rockers 350"". It's very annoying and also makes my Samsung m31 lag",3,0
It is made of low quality plastic which broke within two months of delivery.Worst product not worth for buying. Sound quality is very bad and there is no noise cancellation and bluetooth connection often fail and sometimes it didn't help me for handsfree calling.,1,0
"First of all it's the best thing you can have under 1k . First of all the sound is good , there is minor distortion at full volume but normal person will regret it , although no one will use at full volume . The bass is awesome , vocals are clear and there is some noice cancellation at upper volume . I have issue that the earcups are soft but not for long term use bcoz headphone apply pressure and cups also not manage it . You cannot use for long-term use . The build is plastic and the extenders are also plastic but not that weak that they cannot handle pressure ,  if you do that with patiently . Although a good buy if you want it !!!!",5,1
I used this head the audio quality is fine but mike quality is not good. When I attend a zoom or team meeting then others complaints for voice quality however the internet connection is very good.  I am not totally satisfied with this product. We can not return this item.,2,0
It‚Äôs the best pick for headphones Perfect for an adult to listen to music or watch movies and perfect for a child for his/her online classes. Very happy with the product. It nullifies outside noise n fits on my ear well. The best feature is it‚Äôs adjustable head band which fits perfectly well on my head n  on my child‚Äôs head too‚Ä¶,5,1
The microphone in this headset is terrible. My voice keeps breaking in btween. People on the other side is continuously complaining about sound quality from the headfon. If you are buying it for the purpose of taking calls don‚Äôt go for it. The audio quality and battery is good. The aux cable is useless because we need to have charge in the headset to switch on the headphone in aux cable mode also. We cannot charge while using it.,1,0
"Writing this review after using the headphones for a couple of weeks now. It is an excellent piece of hardware, comfortable to use, easy to operate with a world class sound output.  Battery is long lasting too. It is one of the  must have products if you are a music lover.",5,1
Its been one month since I have been using it for online class. BUT after that one day its strap got broken. And now its of no use if your use is constant just like me then please don't buy it. Overall that's my experience with this ultra delicate headphone. Didn't except this from Boat.,1,0
¬†Nice and decent could be better. Good amount of bass and sometimes you will feel trebles and voice a bit low. But IF YOU ARE USING WITH AUX(WIRED) THEN BUTTONS WILL NOT WORK HAVE TO CONTROL EVERYTHING EITH PHONE/PC THAT'S ACTUALLY WORST. Otherwise when using with BLUETOOTH ALL BUTTONS ARE FUNCTIONAL. Can be recommended easily,4,1
"Average product, though headphone sound quality is good, its mic is bad.Also, the supplied 3.5 mm cable is just for namesake, it's very bad. After using for one day I m going back to my old broken headphones.  Boat has disappointed me. Wish I could return it even if means I lose 20-30 percent of the total cost",3,0
Only goof thing in this headphone is the battery. Around 4-5 days (using 3-4 hour daily). Sound quality is below average. Literally no bass . Everyone in the room can hear what your are listening.Aux cable is very cheap quality and doesn't work properly. After plugging the aux cable you can't hear anything (I've tried 3-4 phones).my personal advice is don't buy this product .,3,0
The sounds quality seems good but that does not matter as the headphones is very hurtful on the ear for adults. I used it once and had ear pain all day. The fit is very bad on the ear and the design does not provide any flexibility. The adjustment provided to expand is very minimal. This is a perfect headphone for teenagers and would not recommend it for adults! The seller does not even accept returns which is a bigger drawback. Think twice before purchasing the headphones.,2,0
"Design and colour is good but ear pad is not soft, sound quality not good according to price. I always think may be amazon sells duplicate or replica item. I always felt like that.",3,0
Everything in this is just perfect! Even tho the ear pad on the left side is kind of bending towards your ear this product is great!Side note: if you want to check how your headphones are working use the song bohemian rhapsody on YouTube or spotify it has everything!,5,1
"Got a damaged one first. re ordered and got .Very good product in all aspcts .slight problem when connecting with aux, sometimes  sound is breaking. But I am TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON RETURN POLICY.....  the damaged product doesn't picked even after THREE WEEKS and  when ever contact to customer care they repeat that item will be picked up within 2 days. The delay is totally annoying",4,1
"Honestly it is worth the money they ask for.I've been using this for the last 2/2.5 months and can say that this is better than any headphones I used before.Pros:-1. Absolutely amazing sound quality . And because of the noise cancellation , even 70% volume is more than enough for listening .2. As a edm listener, I have got to applaud the bass quality which is amazingly awesome in this headphoneCons:-1. The one and only con I've experienced is the earpain after using it for long time.eg- watching a movie or binging a show.Overall it's worth it and you should try it if you're looking for good headphones below 1500 or so.",5,1
"okay, not going to lie, the sound quality was good. the bass was heavy and clear. but that's about it. the headset was so uncomfortably tight i had to take it off every 15 minutes or so. other than that, the microphone was way worse.and don't get me started on the buildup of the headset. the entire thing is made of cheap hard plastic. one twist the wrong way and it'll break. the product is def not worth 1k.i had to return the whole thing. i wouldn't suggest buying this at all.",2,0
"The product came broken. The music is not very clear, the bass is not good. in all if i had paid mrp for the object i would have been furious. But i paid a discount price for this and at that price, this can be justified.",1,0
"Very good quality sound. But I got right side‚Äôs ear padding detached, when received. This was first time for us to understand your procedure. Nobody advised us to send photographs. Any way please collect this defective boAt head phone and refund the full amount on priority. I would like to order fresh on receiving the refund amount",4,1
"It actually was a decent headphone until just a few days later the wireless functions stopped working, no matter how long i pressed the button the lights (which indicates that it is open to accept a Bluetooth pairing) wouldn't blink. But me being the dumb person I am, I didn't contact the seller and thought of just using the wire function which went well until today, the right side of my headphones aren't working. 3 months since I bought it, it has turned completely useless to me ugh i am so mad. Guys and girls, don't be a cheapskate like me and just save money to get a headphone from good company.",3,0
"The design built is very bad. It's extremely small for adults. Size is too small for ears and thus puts lots of pressure on wearing. It's lightweight but of no use because it's a total discomfort on use. Rest sound quality is okay. In short, regret buying.",2,0
Sound and Bass quality is awesome. At high volume it seem very high sound. But overall it's a nice one product,5,1
"Starting with the what all things come inside the boAt Rockerz 370 Wireless Headset is , On Ear Headphone, Micro USB cable(to charge your headset), 3.5mm Audio Cable (to connect your headset with your phone), Manual, Warranty Card(one year warranty card).Starting with the review for the product.Personally i really liked the product, it's sound quality is just awesome and loud such that increasing it volume to max you won't be able to hear outside voice even though noise cancellation is not mentioned in product description, and bass for this headset is really better than other products of same price range.Talking about bluetooth connectivity it's really instant, within fraction of seconds it gets connected to your device , only when you use product for the first time then only it will take a little time ie.4-5 second to connectAnd Battery backup is so good that I haven't charged the headset since the day it has arrived ie 3 days after extensive use.boAt Rockers 370 is surely better than products in same price range in every aspects but I didn't liked the short length of the extension to headset provides by company it's short for me and the cushion cup is soft but ear start paining after using it for 1-2 hours.",4,1
"I bought this maybe 5 months ago. It was working great when one of the pad of the earpiece just broke. I fixed it with fevikwik then it was good as new. Then after 3 days, the whole earpiece broke. It didn't break that much but it was fixable. Then today, the whole earpiece broke apart from the headphone. I didn't to anything to it just broke into 2 peices. I recommend this but idk if it was me or the headphones were of cheap quality.",3,0
I like there quality where a swift car can not make that much strong ness for their own cars speaker that boat had done.. I am really proud of my boat headsets üîä When we keep competition for swift car speakers nd Boat speakers there is no doubt definitely our Indian brand Boat will win.. I know about my boy. Due to our speakers sound swift car parts gets bolt loose..üòÅ,5,1
Not good quality frame it got broken in just 1 month . I will give the ratings of it as -1 which is perfect for it. Now I have to use it by sticking it with gum tape. I will recommend not buy this worst product and waste ur money. It is too different from photo given while purchasing the headphone. Sound quality is bit good but we can hear every thing going on our surrounding and if someone sits beside us or he/she is bit far from us then they can hear the sound from the headphones . The worst product ever seenüëéüëé,1,0
It's better to buy something pricier which provides better quality and durability. Update :I contacted the brand and they took the defective product and since it couldn't be repaired they replaced and delivered a new product as it was under warranty,1,0
I expected a medium performance from this price range. But i get a low quality product from boat. When i using this product for 45min my ears getting uncomfortable.everything they advertising about the product is a complete lie.I never purchased from this brand.,1,0

The headset is good at this price range. it's sound quality is very good. but there are few concerns like - its fitting is very tight and ear gets pain and sweat. Also it gets disconnected while talking in a call.,4,1
"Got this today , would update in case of any notable event , a great product by boat but the comfort could be better as they start causing ear pain after an hour of use , bass is good , not thumping base but can make do , and moreoever , build quality could be better by using metals instead of plastics in points where the headband stretches , got it for my birthday gift , and i must say , its a good gift ,Before buying , do watch bideos of its unboxing and reviews thoBravado to boat for making such a product available in so less price",4,1
"Surprisingly for such a small price, high quality headphones all work as they should.  the only mistake , it does not turn off automatically, if you forget to turn it off, you will run out of battery power.  that's a big minus",4,1
Good at this price point. Buil quality is not satisfying. Battery is good. Feeling pain after 15 minute of use. Aux cable provided with it very cheap. But at this price point no other headset have duo connectivity option,3,0
It is fab to use for the internal purpose and especially to those who are extremely fond of music. It comes with a melodious sound having powerful Bluetooth connectivity. Battery life is amazing. It runs 6 to 7 hours of one time full charge. The product needs to be updated with a memory card slot.,4,1

"This headphone is simply superb.. i bought it for my daughter n she dropped it from the window.. we stay on the 14th floor n it had a straight drop of 10 floors (it fell on the 4th floor podium) ..

"Continues usage, say more than 1-1.30hr may irritate ears. Because of less air circulation around the ears, it may get sweat after some point of time, cushion felt tight fit.

"I took it solely for gaming and WFH purpose. It does the job, I connect it and it stays powered on for more than 8hrs a day on a single full charge. Music, gaming and calls.

Lows are pretty decent. The highs are not that great",5,1

"1) The sound quality is very poor, it's barely passable using in Bluetooth, but with the aux cords provided in the box it's absolutely garbage.2) the build quality feels very cheap and flimsy. It feels like it'd break in half if I try to put even a little bit of force.3) the size of the earpieces are quiet small. It starts to hurt my ears after 5-10 minutes of usage. This headphone is not made for people with average to big head.",1,0

Many time...the other person cannot hear our voice through headphones....many times v r not able to hear there voice...so needs to reconnect ...it shws disconnected even if its connected...,2,0
its sound is very good its not noise cancellation but deep bass is so good that you will feel noise cancelation feature I prefer this headphone to music lovers and online studies and you can connect with aux cable and bluetooth.Note: if your network is slow or weak the headphone will not give a good sound,5,1
Truly good productNice sound qualityIt has wire also to connect headphones to laptop/phone so that if the device has not bluetooth function you can connect headphones with the device,5,1
After using for 2 months it started disconnecting from bluetooth automatically.And the material is also of very low quality.Mine headphone broke when I was trying to wear it and when asked for servicing they said that the sound is comming and we will not do anything.Cheap quality.Buy some other headphone of boat only but don't buy this one.Total waste of money...,1,0
Good product under 1000First one in 999 and second one in 799In a weekAnd battery backup is awesome for studyAnd also good for listening music.,5,1
"First the audio jack gave trouble and then I started using the Bluetooth mode. It's now dead in 1 week of usage. Good sound quality not at all durable, bought in July 2021. Not recommended",1,0
"Not comfortable to use as the cushion pads presses the ears tightly so that you will get irritated just after 10 mins of use. Better to go for the ones which has bigger ear pads, so that it covers your full ear. There is no return policy also, so I couldn't return it. Better not to go with this. Sound and build quality is ok.",4,1
"Well over all its good choice and good looking at this peice rangeBut some times it just stops working and just didn't switched on even after pressing the power button for a long time also the cushion paddingbis not soft so it causes pain in my ear after prolong use , and there are better choice in the market",4,1
It is very good i mean the sound and all it good at this price range. But its build quality is not upto the mark and it may break easily on the edges and most importantly the charging point and aux cable are creating few problems in the device but in some device they perform okay. So it have some problems but at this price range i think it is okay.üôÇ,4,1
"When i got it then that day it was working completely fine with macbook using Bluetooth but now no matter what i do it doesn't connect with Bluetooth to my mac, have to use wire which limits me to sit in my chair, however the Bluetooth works fine with android device. and the ear hurts after using around half an hour. i don't say product is bad but these two things are not working me.",1,0
Rechargeable battery dies contantly.  The microphone does not work.  It is just a wired headphone with ordinary sound.  Just deception.  Worthless junk.,1,0
"The only good thing about these headphones is average sound quality. Nothing to boast of. The major issue is that they are VERY uncomfortable. They dont fit your ears and they would give immense pain within an hour of constant usage. That said, they can't be returnable or replacable. I feel like its a waste of 1000 Rs.",1,0
I tell you guys don't invest money on this buy air pods or air buds because I have used it for 6-8 months all good but the strips from where we extend the headphones that is of very low quality and that's the main thing...

The box I received was little bit damaged. These headphones are attractive but build quality is poor.Aux cable sound is horrible.

Pathetic product and service. Flip got broken within 3 months and when i went to service center they said it wont consider under warranty and when i asked to repair by taking some charge they denied to do that as well. It means if you buy boat product and it got broke for any reason in one day then u just have to through your product into. Dustbin. DO NOT BUY BOAT ANY PRODUCT,1,0
"It's been a year since I have been using this and it had no problem when it arrived. Last month or so the charging port came lose. I think this was damage done on my part, however I still advise to be a little careful with the charging port. I gave it to company for repair as it was still under warranty and they repaired it without any cost. Other than that no problem at all.",4,1
This is a very good headphone to use. Everything with the sound is top class.Just the build quality could elevate it to a better standard.Otherwise it's quite good!,4,1
Needs nearly every day need to charge if 10+ hours usage per day. Specifically in WFHome scenario. In Ubuntu sometimes having issues with this. Windows it's super cool.,5,1

This Boat Rockerz 370 wireless headphone is perfect for rock and metal maniacs in this price range which is not only value for money but also good sound quality with good amount of bass and overall it's a must buy product,3,0
",  also rarely it feels like it shakes voice with breaks like it used to happen in tape recorder/ caset sound, this gets one of incidence but that occurence is the sole point for deduction of 2 stars on overall basis, even if I pay 900 rupees, I will expect finest line of product from such an established brand, after Sony series of headphones it's one of the best",3,0

Happy for the quality at the price it is offered at. Good product.This does not mean anything is compromised in the quality. Just don't compare to way too high priced ones.,5,1

Sound quality is just awesome but Call connectivity is very poor.. much sweat and ear becomes hot..,1,0
"These headphones are very uncomfortable. I could barely wear them long enough to test if this any good.

Got it for 1099 during sale.",3,0
The product doesn't have any problem with sound quality or noise cancellation but its not durable enough it broke within 2 months. It causes some pressure in your ears which is very uncomfortable for wearing it even for 1 hr max.,3,0

"Really presses against the ears which becomes painful after a while. Can't use for long duration. Though I haven't tried many other headphones so don't know if this is normal. Hoped it would become loose after some use, but it's still the same.",4,1
"Sound quality is not good, no bass, no noice cancellation and normal sound getting in high volume also... product looks good but music lovers it's not suitable....I expected alot from boat Rockerz 370 but it's not met as expected sound",2,0
Truly Noise cancellation and high sound quality. Superb bass. Amazing and long lasting battery life. The only issue is sometimes I have a little bit pain under my ears otherwise happy with purchase. Feels like I'm in a live concert when listening music in it. Also I got it on sale.,5,1
If u are holding up for a quality product...then it's not for you the material that is used to extend the headphones are so cheap it will bread down easily if u just apply a little bit of force .. secondly it's bass is not as what I expected it's like okay and noice cancellation is good overall a good product but with cheap quality .,1,0

"The audio quality is great. Looks great, too. The only thing is, the microphone does not capture sound very well. You may need to buy an aux cable with a mic.",5,1
"It's too good to purchase. Along with Bluetooth it also has chord. If you want you can use it with chord, like headphones without Bluetooth",5,1
"I searched for better headphones and searched end when I saw first my favourite boat-rockers, headphone, amazing quality , good base, easily connected with Bluetooth, and easy to carry. All good m very happy to buy this in a super saver deal.worth it",5,1
Everything about this product is pretty good except that it's not as comfortable as I thought it would be. After wearing for about 30 mins your ears can start to pain.Another thing that I did not like is that the music leaks out and people near you can easily hear to what you're listening.,3,0
Super sound quality butWhen we play high graphic gamesThe sound is bit slower than the real time2 seconds slowerWhen we play games like pubg and free fireSo update the bluetooth versionNd the sound quality is rich base is ultimate,5,1
"Do not buy this cheap plastic headphones if you are going to use them every day.  As i mentioned earlier it is made from cheap plastic and it will break itself in 4/5 months.

Sound aint loud. Bass is ok. Connectivity issue is bigger problem.,1,0
Good sound but can't use for very long time. It's starts hurting your years after 30 min of use.If you have low budget the go for this or else spend 1000 bucks more and you'll get a far better product.,3,0
The sound quality is not as expected. Some crackling sound in background while listening on Bluetooth and air input.,4,1
"On high bass, the voice seems to crack a bit. Would bother if you are extremely particular voice at high levels. Else a great product!! The battery life is significantly good in the price range this product is available and the facility of connecting through 3.5mm jack is something not available in this price range.",4,1
Battery backup superb.Apart from size issue the rockerz has no problem.When u take it off ears n tend to snug around neck the band seems to be tight around neck n for that u have to hold it off ur neck...Size cud be an inch more..size means size of interconnecting band between two ear phones even after full stretch,4,1
Great product but need some improvement in noise cancellation and material.Should me made more comfortable to wear.,3,0
"Sound is good, but build quality too bad.... broke off in a month... dont know now wat to do with it , cant return it too",2,0

I haven't charged this thing since 4 days now. Its still at 60% and i use it every night for around 6 hrs or so during sleep. Perfect for noise cancellation if you have a society of barking dogs after midnight lol.  On a serious note the audio outputs coming out are decent,5,1
"I am using this Bluetooth for the last 7 months, sound quality is good. A few days back support strip got broken and now it is not usable. The boat should use quality material at least for their brand image. I am trying on their customer care centre for replacement but there is no revert to calls.",2,0
It is not having the features which is mentioned on product. Mostly you are not able to connect both mobile and laptop at the same time. And if anyhow some time it's get connected then. If you get call or if you watch any video or songs the voice/sounds gap comes  or sounds distorted.,3,0
"The plastic use is really poor, pls do not buy it as it's only have replacement policy which is not recommended... Really cheap plastic use.. any hard push will break it istant",1,0

Sound and bass are well definable for such price the only thing why i returned it is I can't wear it for more than 30 mins at a time because its on-ear type and my ears start to hurt after certain period of time after wearing it,3,0
Though bass and noise cancellation are a bit lagging. The value for the amount given is extremely good.,5,1
It fulfills value for money in this range... If you want something in this range.. Can definitely go for it... The battery is upto 7-8 hours... And the material used is also of a good quality...You can choose it in this range,5,1

"Honest review will act as a guide to buy thia product1. Sound quality is very nice but we can expect more as boat is good company2. They are good in fitting and ear cups are also of good build quality3. Noise cancellation is not present but earcups make that good enough4. One of the best at this price range i got it for 999Cons1. At starting these will be tight to wear, can't wear for long time in summers as the ears get heated up2. Volume is too high even at lowest possible volume you will feel like you are playing song at 50 % volume3. Lack of controls, you can't fast forward the song and sometimes it doesn't start on pressing the play button4. Seems to be delicate and fragileHope it helps...!!",4,1
"Main features are crystal clear sound quality. At very high nodes sound is melodious & beats are powerful. Seems this device is made for bass lovers. High fidality sound could be judged on display of connected device. Low nodes are clear. Various music types like rock, pop, jazz & classical could be enjoyed by listener. Good sound listening experience. Ding dong ding with boat rockers 370.",5,1
Awesome product shant jha,5,1
"Sound quality is good for music. Very average call quality. The other person may not hear you if you change your position. This is when you connect the aux cable.If you're using it in Bluetooth mode, then forget about calls. The other person won't be able to hear at all.Also, the foam is not comfortable and you can't use it for more than an hour at a time, so wouldn't suggest for office use. Suitable for people with smaller ears.",2,0
‚óè Sound quality really good. Bass is better than good imo.‚óè Playing a few games like BGMI/Pokemon Unite/Terraria/Minecraft etc. More than enough to keep track whats happening in game.‚óè Charge takes atleast 6 days to get to 20% from full. I am using it daily wireless atleast 7 hour. comes with a wire too.All and all this is a very good budget headset.,4,1
"Wireless feature with windows PC works but the lowest sound is too loud and audible from 6 level only. If we make it wired then the sound is controllable and can be set lower than 6 on PC. After 1 month of use, it is getting disconnected automatically and connecting again with Moto one action phone. Edit1: It broke after 6 months, Looks like it was designed to be broken after some months. Wouldn't recommend this product.",1,0
"Disgusting. Only can listen music in player, discontinued sound while paly videos or movies, or video call even interruption during voice calls, when ask for return in the very next day they display msg that my pick up location didn't found üòÇ. What a pathetic customer service. It's only brand name with star advertisement. Worthless product I will never buy this brand.",1,0
"I ordered this a few months ago and forgot to write a review, so now now I'll be writing the review this product really deserves:It's amazing! It looks really nice, is kinda flexible and the sound quality is awesome. It charges quickly and lasts at least 10 hours on one charge, which is perfect for me since I have classes. Really happy I ordered this, love it.",5,1
Scintillating head phones. Very nice bass.Perhaps better noise cancellation was needed.Color is good. Looks trendy.Feel is OK ok,5,1
¬†More than one year use get little damage but still rocking with the audio quality and clarity beast for gaming  only issue is fitting but over all it's good for this price and best one too. I had bought it for 1300 - 1400 something now it's price drop so no more thinging book it and rock it üòá,3,0
The sound quality is excellent but cushion pads are very stiff and even after just one hours of use my ears started hurting. Everything is 5 star about this headphones but for the uncomfortable cushioning I'll have to give it 4 stars,4,1
Awesome.....so comfortable on ears ..sound quality battery very good .,4,1
"Have been using it for 5 days, the sound quality if good but the biggest issue is that it has very small earcups and that makes it very uncomfortable to wear, if you are a casual user then sure go ahead buy it, but for users who wanna use it for long durations i would recommend buy something else instead, these are very uncomfortable to wear.",2,0
Head band is too weak and poor quality it cracks from different places post a year its looses its quality.. but sound is gd and ear pad cusion skin also poor,1,0
Looks nice. But the earcups are not comfortable. It gets disconnected and then gets connected automatically several times. Don't know why. Sound quality is not good at all. Really a bad experience for me. I just wasted my money on this headphone.,1,0
This is average. Sound quality is ok but I hear static when their is a pause in song. Also mic quality is. It good. Can‚Äôt use it for calling. Otherwise it is ok.,3,0
"I connected it to my android phone via Bluetooth to listen the songs. But when I turn on the mobile's HotSpot to connect my laptop WiFi, sound started to break. If I turn off the Hotspot, sound is ok and as soon as I turn on the HotSpot again sound starting to break.Not sure if it's manufacuting defect in all products or I just received a faulty piece.",3,0
It is a scam. Boat charges you for everything. But the 3.5 mm aux provided in the package doesn't work. It is also not covered under warranty and would not be replaced under any circumstances.,1,0
Quality of body is poor,3,0
"I bought it for my cousns twice, got nice base the only thing i don't like is whn uh raise its voice evry1 around uh can hear coz its loud but othr than ths it's beautiful, budget friendly product",4,1
"I like , its come in good package, well in time,specially in remorts areas or where not available in markets.As per prize it is good. For students for ooline classes.",5,1
Dont buy it its poor quality product which is imported from china and sold in the name of boatIts better to buys some indian product istead of this 3rd class boat products,1,0
The left earpiece is facing outward and does not twist inward. I cannot use this item. I contacted Amazon customer support but they were not willing to help with this item. This is the 1st Boat item I purchased and the experience has been terrible. Will not buy or recommend Boat products to anyone.,1,0
I purchased the product two days back @ Rs.1199/ but the same product today price is Rs.999/.I lost Rs.200 in one day,1,0

I did not like these pair of headphones..Painful to ears..mic doesnot works properly....the person on other side can barely hear me,3,0
Someone gifted this to me as a Secret Santa gift in office. Though the look is good it just connects to my apple Ipad but does not connect to any of the Laptops or Samsung F62 phone.Bluetooth compatibility is a big time issue.,1,0
Just break like that.... Very disappointed... It's looks good sound is good too. but they should work on the durability of the product,2,0
Cheapest plastic is used.Only right side plays with aux cable.Bluetooth connection breaks when you are moving fastSound quality is not very good. Bass is lacking.Sound hurts too muchDon't go for it,1,0
"After 9 days, bluetooth not working, returned time also exceed, no option for repairments, want to change the device or buy other product",2,0
"Nice product, build quality is fantastic.. on full volume it will not sound good however on middle volume it sounds great.. Nice bass and clarity... 4 stars from me..",4,1
Bass quality is not upto mark but still recommend this because of good battery backup & inbuilt microphone facility for calling purpose.,4,1
Stuttering in sound when connected with bluetooth so requested for a replacement order but replaced device has same issues.Better if connected using headphone jack.,3,0
"op headphone with good bass (not as much as earbuds/neckband), but with good vocals ,Just a Reminder who those who wanna buy for Gaming :- It has latency issuealmost no sound leak unless and until you are in complete silence room at 100%",4,1

"Sound Quality, Noise Cancellation and Bass Quality is also good",5,1
"Pros1) Good Sound Quality with decent Bass2) Decent noice cancellation due to Tight earcussions.3) Great Aesthetics and Light WeightCons1) Sometimes there is no sound in one of the earcups2) They are not comfortable even for short period use. I ordered it specifically for online meetings but  they are uncomfortable and causes pain over ears in just 30 minutes. So forget long usage. Company claims these are""Ergonomically designed"". No they are not. It is designed such that if you increase headband size, they become more tight. There's no point of good sound quality if you can't wear them.Conclusion: Don't buy these if you looking for comfortable headphones. Buy these headphones only for their design. You can get same sound quality in other headphones for same price.",3,0

"These headphones are okay and a good deal for the price in my opinion. For me, the sound quality is a little subpar and I feel the high frequencies are really suppressed in these headphones.So from a music mixing and just pure listening perspective, they AREN'T good at all. But since they are so compact and light, they make ideal headphones for running and working out with, where you are not as concerned with the drawbacks I mentioned. I like them and they work well for the way I use them.Not the most tech-savvy perspective but hope this helps.",4,1
